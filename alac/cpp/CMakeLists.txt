# This is a C++ library used by `full_run` test to perform
# an integration test of `cpp_to_rust`.
# The library is built and passed to `cpp_to_rust` to produce a crate.
# The test itself is located at `cpp_to_rust/cpp_to_rust_generator/src/tests/full_run.rs`.
#
# To enhance the test, add or change types and methods in this library
# and put corresponding tests in `cpp_to_rust/cpp_to_rust_generator/test_assets/ctrt1/crate/tests`
# directory.
